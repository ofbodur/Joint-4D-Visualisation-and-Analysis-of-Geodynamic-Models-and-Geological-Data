# Joint-4D-Visualisation-and-Analysis-of-Geodynamic-Models-and-Geological-Data

This repository is complementary to the manuscript submitted to Geoscientific Model Development. 

It includes Python (3.8) and shell scripts, each referenced to the article in regard to their purpose of creation and/or modification from existing open-source codes. A sample CitcomS geodynamic model output for a single timestep (180 Ma) is also shared for the purpose of enabling users to test the framework in their own platforms. 

I always appreciate feedback to improve this repository.
